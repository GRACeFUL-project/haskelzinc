   constraints for CRUD", by N. Beldiceanu, E. Arafailova, R. Douence.
 - MiniZinc boolean, integer and floating point literals are now represented easily with
   Haskell literals. Functions "int", "bool" and "float" are not necessary any more.

   represented easily with the name of that variable as a Haskell string.
 - Simpler declaration of variables and user-defined operations.

0.3.0.0
 - Added support for annotations
 - Structural changes in the representational system of MiniZinc models
 - Module Interfaces.MZAST renamed to Interfaces.MZASTBase

 - Module Interfaces.MZBuiltIns added. Contains haskelzinc represenatation of predefined MiniZinc 
   operators, functions, tests, predicates and annotations.
 - Module Interfaces.FZSolutionParser provides parsers useful for building custom solutions' 
   parsers, in case a MiniZinc output item alters the default format of the solutions.
 - Compatibility with GHC 8.0.1 tested (and passed)

0.2.0.0
 - Added support for returning specified number of solutions
 - Interactive interface of iTestModel improved
